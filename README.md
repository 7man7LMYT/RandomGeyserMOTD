# RandomGeyserMOTD
A Geyser extension that displays a randomized primary MOTD whenever pinged.

## Usage
To edit or change the list of MOTDs, head into the extension folder and edit `motds.txt`. Each line will be treated as a single MOTD.
If the extension fails to load or finds nothing in the MOTD file, it will default to using the extension name.
